## My_Lab
My program accepts as input the full path to the file or the name of the file (if it is in the same folder as the project) and the separator symbol by which the data will be separated.
For storage, I used an Arraylist. After receiving a complete package of information about a human and a subdivision, the program created an object and added it to the list.
To output to the screen, I used the written print function.
